In 2018, GuildOne conducted the worldâ€™s first blockchain oil and gas royalty transaction on Energy Block Exchange (EBX), its blockchain business network for energy transactions. \n\nAt GuildOne, I primarily worked on ConTracks, the world's first O&G royalty transaction. During my time on ConTracks, I was able to get Corda certified! This meant that I have a solid knowledge of blockchain concepts such as blocks, transactions, consensus, UTXO, smart contracts, public key cryptography. As well, I am able to contribute, read and maintain Corda applications. The ConTracks software has many different moving parts, I work primarily on the front end and the middle layer where the API communicates to the blockchain layer.\n\nAs part of the team working on ConTracks, I helped research in the implementation of a new web interface. Previously, ConTracks was available only as a desktop application. Since the application was written in the Scala programming language, I decided to use Scala.js. Scala.js is a compiler that compiles Scala source code to equivalent JavaScript code. With this ability to convert Scala code to JavaScript, I was able to use React as our front end. This is my first exposure to React, and so far, it's easy to see why it's one of JavaScript's most popular front end frameworks!\n\nI also help develop an internal documentation site where GuildOne employees could go and look up either business related information about a product, to technical documentation about API endpoints to blockchain concepts used. This is a great opportunity for me to learn more about pipelines that are used in BitBucket and Docker Hub. I also help maintain the technical aspect of GuildOne's website by keeping the development environment separate from the live site using an Ubuntu server.",

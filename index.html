                                    <p>At GuildOne, I primary work on ConTracks, the world's first O&G royalty transaction. During my time on ConTracks, I was able to get Corda certified! This meant that I have a solid knowledge of blockchain concepts such as blocks, transactions, consensus, UTXO, smart contracts, public key cryptography. As well, I am able to contribute, read and maintain Corda applications. While working on ConTracks, with it has has many different moving parts, I work primarily on the front end and the middle layer where the API communicates to the blockchain layer. </p>
                                    <p>The front end is primarily done in JavaFX, Oracle's software platform for delivering desktop applications. In the application, I help in creating a better user experience while maintaining functionality for users. The application is able to format tables, export data and import data.</p>
                                    <p>Another new tool in my arsenal was being exposed to QA testing. I was part of a small team that tested the API where we did numerous types of testing such as validation testing, functional testing, runtime/error detection.</p>

                                    <p>As part of the team working on ConTracks, I helped research in the implementation of a new web interface. Previously, ConTracks was available only as a desktop application. Since the application was written in the Scala programming language, I decided to use Scala.js. Scala.js is a compiler that compiles Scala source code to equivalent JavaScript code. With this ability to convert Scala code to JavaScript, I able to use React as our front end. This is my first exposure to React, and so far, it's easy to see why it's one of JavaScript's most popular front end frameworks!  </p>

                                    <p>I also help develop an internal documentation site where GuildOne employees could go and look up either business related information about a product, to technical documentation about API endpoints to blockchain concepts used. This was a great opportunity for me to learn more about pipelines that are used in BitBucket and Docker Hub.  I also help maintain the technical aspect of GuildOne's <a href="www.guild1.co">website </a>by keeping the development environment separate from the live site using an Ubuntu server. </p>

                                        schedules online. As a member of this project, I was tasked with
                                        helping make administrative work easier. This included custom programming of
                                        generating PDFs, invoices, mass excel sheets that could pull in specific data
                                        and implementing a mass emailing system to all athletes or parents of particular
                                        camps.
                                        Setting up camps previously was tedious on their old system and the
                                        administrative backend
                                        allowed them to quickly add camps by importing Excel spreadsheets.

                                        Speed Demon Lights is a Magento site that specializes in truck accessories and
                                        LED lighting options. I helped Speed Demon Lights make their site easier for
                                        customers to roam their site. This was one of my bigger Magento projects that
                                        challenged me. During this project, I was tasked with making their checkout site
                                        more efficient and as well, adding a social media page that pulled in their
                                        videos from Vimeo. I was able to learn a lot about Magento from my work on Speed
                                        Demon Lights.

                                        aspects. The set of skills she has acquired will prove very useful for any
                                        business. She is a team player who works well in groups.
                                        I remember doing a presentation alongside her in one of my classes where she
                                        made sure that the project tasks were thoroughly completed on time to present
                                        while she researched her own part on the side. When
                                        it was time to present, she delivered a presentation nothing short of brilliant.

                                    <p>Above all her professional qualities, she is a good person. Her willingness to
                                        help others when she sees them struggling is a quality not found in many people.
                                        I believe her skills will prove extremely useful to
                                        any business that is willing to give her an opportunity. &nbsp&nbsp <i

                            <p>I want to promote a more female awareness in the IT industry. IT is generally regarded as
                                a male-dominated field and there is a low number of females present in the industry. I
                                hope to inspire the next generation of young
                                females to join the IT industry, to make a difference and showcase more gender equality
                                in the IT field. One way to promote more awareness is to advertise Girls/Ladies Learning
                                Code, an organization that is aimed at
                                females from all ages to focus on teamwork, creativity and embrace technology. Girls
                                Learning Code aims to show how tech can be a medium for self-changing and changing the
                                world. </p>

                            <p>I attended the University of Calgary for nursing in my first year out of high school. I
                                really enjoyed it and also loved the people I met, but I didn't see it as a career
                                choice for myself. I transferred over to Computer
                                Science a year later, and then transferred over to SAIT for a more hands-on experience
                                afterwards.</p>

                                    <p>At GuildOne, I primary work on EBX, the world's first O&G royalty transaction. During my time on EBX, I was able to get Corda certified! This meant that I have a solid knowledge of blockchain concepts such as Blocks, Transactions, Consensus, UTXO, Smart contracts, Public key cryptography. As well, I am able to contribute to writing Corda code and developing Corda applications. I learn a lot while working on EBX as it has many different moving parts. I work primarily on the front end and the middle layer where the API is laid before talking to the blockchain layer.  </p>
                                    <p>The front end is primarily done in JavaFX, Oracle's software platform for delivering desktop applications. In the application, I help in creating a better format to render data visually by redesigning the user interface while increasing functionality for sorting tables.</p>
                                    <p>Another new tool in my arsenal was being exposed to QA testing. I was part of a small team that tested the API where we did numerous types of testing such as validation testing, functional testing, runtime/error detection.</p>

                                <div class="col-md-12">
                                    <p>While working on EBX, I also initiate in the implementation a new web interface for EBX. Previously, EBX was available on a desktop application. Since EBX was written in the Scala programming language, I decided to use Scala.js. Scala.js is a compiler that compiles Scala source code to equivalent JavaScript code. With this ability to convert Scala code to JavaScript, we were able to use React as our front end. This is my first exposure to React, and so far, no wonder why it's one of JavaScript's most popular front end frameworks!  </p>

                                    <p>During my time at GuildOne, I also help develop an internal documentation site where GuildOne employees could go and look up either business related information about a product, to technical documentation about API endpoints to blockchain concepts used. This was a great opportunity for me to learn more about pipelines that are used in BitBucket and Docker Hub.  </p>

                                        that helped tailor and custom program parts of the site. This included
                                        invoicing, custom email templates and generating shipping labels to help Single
                                        Cup's warehouse make the shipment process easier.

                                        Bilt Ringette is a ringette site that allows athletes to register and make their
                                        schedules online. As a member of this project, I was tasked with
                                        helping make administrative work easier. This included custom programming of
                                        generating PDFs, invoices, mass excel sheets that could pull in specific data
                                        and implementing a mass emailing system to all athletes or parents of particular
                                        camps.
                                        Setting up camps previously was tedious on their old system and the

                                        allowed them to quickly add camps by importing Excel spreadsheets.

                                        Speed Demon Lights is a Magento site that specializes in truck accessories and
                                        LED lighting options. I helped Speed Demon Lights make their site easier for
                                        customers to roam their site. This was one of my bigger Magento projects that
                                        challenged me. During this project, I was tasked with making their checkout site
                                        more efficient and as well, adding a social media page that pulled in their
                                        videos from Vimeo. I was able to learn a lot about Magento from my work on Speed
                                        Demon Lights.

                                Nguyen and Jade Low approached me with the opportunity to develop and take a step
                                forward with their company. By carefully taking in their
                                input and getting a sense of who they are and their business, DNIT.ca was created.

                                        goes above and beyond expectations is phenomenal and will be a remarkable

                                in the IT field. One way to promote more awareness is to advertise Girls/Ladies Learning

                            <p>I attended the University of Calgary for nursing in my first year out of high school. I
                                really enjoyed it and also loved the people I met, but I didn't see it as a career
                                choice for myself. I transferred over to Computer
                                Science a year later, and then transferred over to SAIT for a more hands-on experience
                                afterwards.</p>
